                    Hi! I'm George - thank you for checking out my personal website! 
                    
                    <br><br>
                    Iâ€™m 
                    a senior at CMU majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering
                    with a minor in Game Design. I am passionate about digital signal 
                    processing, computer graphics, and electronic music. I am interested in
                    the intersection of computer science/engineering with visual art and music, 
                    which you can explore more of on this website.

                    In this website you will find 
                    some details about previous video games programming projects that I've worked on. 
                    I have experience
                    making games in with C# & Unity and making games C++ & OpenGL.

                        <h2>My game development history</h2>
                        I started my journey with video game programming way back when I was in middle school.
                        I used to play Roblox religiously, and I especially enjoyed playing the 
                        obstacle course games, also called "obbies". I would even make my own obbies using
                        Roblox Studio (Roblox's software tool for making worlds on their 
                        platform). Eventually, I started writing little Lua scripts to make
                        my Roblox worlds more fun. 
                        
                        <br><br>
                        Fast forward a few years and I began high school. I didn't play 
                        Roblox anymore, but I was still interested in game development. 
                        I watched game development tutorials all the time and would mess 
                        around making little levels in Unity. For my first game dev
                        development project popular I recreated the indie horror
                        game called "Slender" in Unity. I had a few of my friends play it 
                        and I even scared some of my friends and family!
                        
                        <br><br>
                        At CMU,
                        I found other students at CMU with a similar passion for games
                        as me when I joined Game Creation Society (GCS). It's a 
                        student organization where we create small games each semester.
                        I'm currently in my spring semester of my senior year, and I have worked
                        on 7 semester-long game projects with them so far. I've also 
                        worked on a few game jams here and there. Before CMU,
                        I hadn't met anyone else that enjoyed making games as much as I do.
                        It's been a pleasure working with GCS.
                        
                        <br><br>
                        My most recent project with GCS was <a href="videogame-html/lingua-litis.html">Lingua Litis</a>, a 2 player 
                        word-spelling game where 2 wizards battle each other. I worked 
                        as a project lead and a programmer.

                        <br><br>
                        Also, I took a Computer Game Programming course last fall and I 
                        will be taking Advanced Game Studio this spring.

                    I do non-technical things too! I enjoy playing jazz piano,
                    making electronic music, taking photos of 
                    food, and learning about languages (currently studying Spanish and
                    Japanese). I also play Starcraft II sometimes :)
