            <i>Fall 2018 - Game Programming & Design (PyGame)</i>
            <br><br>
            <h1>Overview</h1>
            BEATDOWN is a videogame that can analyze a music file and generate a level that the player needs to complete while listening to the music. 
            This is my term project for Fundamentals of Programming 15-112 at Carnegie Mellon. 
            I wrote all of the game logic and graphics code using PyGame and Python's built-in libraries.
            The player is a green square that moves around with the computer’s mouse movement, and the enemies are larger squares that fly across the screen with the music.
            Check out the
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Y65BlN4CPU&feature=youtu.be">video</a>
            that I made.
            <br><br>

            <h1>Competitive Analysis</h1>
            I took much inspiration for the concept of BEATDOWN from a
            video game called Audiosurf. In Audiosurf, the player can 
            select music files on his/her computer and surf through cool
            looking levels to the beat of the music. I thought
            that this is a great idea because it leverages the 
            music that they already enjoy.
            <br><br>
            For my project, I didn't want to analyze the music with the 
            same complexity as Audiosurf. I just wanted my project to 
            be able to detect the beat of the music and generate enemies 
            based on the ‘intensity’ of the music. Instead of the player
            surfing through a pretty 3d environment, the player will 
            be a green square that is controlled by the mouse movement.
            <br><br>
            BEATDOWN is different from other rhythm games like Dance 
            Dance Revolution or Osu because there is no way to fail
            a level. Instead, the player will receive a score at the 
            end of the song based on how many object he/she successfully
            dodged. But, no matter how bad that player is at playing the character,
            the player should be able to continue.
            <br><br>
            <h1>Algorithmic Plan</h1>
            The most difficult part of the project is making the music synched up with the animations displayed by PyGame. Here are the steps I am going to take to synch the music with the animations:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Analyze the music file for the song
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>
                            Gather data about the song’s loudness and frequency spectrum for every frame of
                            animation that we need. In out case, we want the game to run around 60 frames
                            per second.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Play the music..
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>
                            To play the music and run the graphics animation at the same time, I have to use Python’s ‘threading’ module.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Every 1/60th of a second, my music thread will send information to my animation code.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Synch the music with the animation.
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>
                            At every animation frame, the game will 
                            interpret data about the music currently
                            playing, and spawn enemies accordingly. If 
                            a section of music is louder than other sections, 
                            then more enemies will be spawned. Since we 
                            gathered data about the music file already, 
                            all we need to do is read a neatly formatted
                            list with the data we need.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If the music is currently ‘on beat’, the enemies will move faster.
                        </li>
                    <ol>
                </li>
            </div>
        </div>
