                <i>August 2019 - Game Programming/Design (Unity) & Music</i>
                <br><br>
                <h1>Overview</h1>
                I'm a huge fan of horror games. In middle school, I used to play 
                a game called "Slender: The Eight Pages", where a tall slender 
                man chases you around, moving only when you aren't looking at him.
                If you look at him for too long you die. I know - it sounds 
                super corny. But at the time, it scared me to death!
                <br><br>
                This is actually something that I had wanted to work on for a long time.
                In fact, in high school I had spent many hours programing and designing
                a level for my own Slender game. I even made my own Slenderman model 
                in blender. Sadly, I ended up trashing the project
                after I lost all of my work because I forgot to "Save Scene"
                <i>and</i> "Save Project" in Unity. Oops.
                <br><br>
                My second attempt at the game went much more smoothly. Instead of 
                spending lots of time creating models and making everything 
                from scratch, I focused more on programming and level design. I was 
                shocked to discover how long it took to design (what I considered
                to be) a simple level in Unity. If I had to estimate, I would say 
                that 60% of the time spent on this project was me placing objects
                and painting onto the terrain.
                <br><br>
                Although level design took a long time, the most difficult part of the 
                project was the Slenderman follow script. It had to do several things:
                <ol>
                    <li>Move when the player is not looking</li>
                    <li>Should not overlap with surrounding objects after moving
                        to a new location</li>
                    <li>Get closer to the player with each page collected</li>
                    <li>Play death sound and animation when the player looks for too long</li>
                </ol>
                Since this was my first real Unity project (I had a ton of unfinished projects
                from before this), this script was a challenge. I didn't even know what a coroutine was. 
                Needless to say, it was a really great learning experience.
                <br><br>
                <b>Speaking of learning lessons, I found out that I can't show you any
                pictures of this project because I didn't use any source control! Big mistake.</b>
                The project files are stored on my desktop computer, which had to be moved
                into storage last-minute once the Covid19 pandemic started. I would have 
                loved to put screenshots and some gameplay into this article. If only
                I had gotten into the habit of using source control sooner... I took 
                a introductory C source at my school the following fall semester and 
                ever since I always make sure to back up my code. I will 
                definitely put screenshots once I gain access to my computer - so
                stay tuned for that!
                <br><br>
                I wrote my own music for the game using Logic Pro X. Luckily, I still have it:
