            <i>Spring 2021 - Game Programming (Unity)</i>
            <br><br>
            <h1>Overview</h1>
            This is my 6th project with <a href="http://www.gamecreation.org">Game Creation Society</a>
            (GCS) at CMU.
            <br><br>

            <a href="https://www.gamecreation.org/games/escape_from_lab_8">Escape From Lab 8</a> is a roguelike dungeon crawler, where you play as 
            a unnamed test subject who must complete a deadly challenge to keep their life.
            <br><br>
            The player's movement is confined to a grid and the plyer must collect 
            items, defeat monsters, and navigate through a procedurally generated 
            environment to make it to the end of each level. There are a total of 3
            levels, and each level has a different theme.
            <br><br>
            <h1>My Role</h1>
            My role in this project was creating interesting environments for each 
            of the 3 levels. I programmed <b>procedural room generation</b> for 2 of the levels 
            and integrated it into the existing room placement pipeline. I also programmed a 
            tool that reads level assets (encoded as PNG) and imports the level
            game.
            <br><br>
            At the beginning of the semester, our project lead had already 
            created some starter code for placing rooms and connecting them together. 
            It was a great start! However, all of the rooms were rectangular and 
            they were all roughly the same size. I started by
            extending the existing room creation framework to allow for more 
            complicated and interesting environments, which I used extensively in 
            Level 1.
            <br><br>
             
            <h3> Level 1 </h3>
            I added circular rooms, rectangular 
            rooms, and annulus (2D donut) rooms. The 
            width and height of the rooms are randomly generated between 2 
            constants, which is specified inside of the Unity Editor.

            <br><br>

            <br><br>
            <h3> Level 2 </h3>
            Instead of many different rooms, this level is one giant cave room. 
            I used the <b>cellular automata</b> approach for generating the room. 
            The environment is modelled as a 2D array of ones and zeros. A 0 means 
            that the tile is a wall and the player cannot cross through, and a 1 
            means that the tile is open and the player can walk through. 
            The grid is initially populated randomly with 0's and 1's and then
            the grid gets updated according to a special set of rules (explained below). 
            <br><br>
            Here's a short summary of the steps for generating the cave room via cellular 
            automata:
            <br><br>
            <ol>
                <li>Fill up a grid with random binary noise.</li>
                <li>If a cell has more than X '1' nighbors, this cell gets converted
                    to a 1. Otherwise, it dies and becomes a 0.</li>
                <li>Repeat the previous step until the grid looks cool</li>
            </ol>
            There's lots of parameters that we can tweak to change the appearance of
            the caves. For example, the distribution of 0's and 1's at step (1), 
            the value of X in step (2), and the number of repetitions in step (3)
            can all dramatically affect the appearance. Here's a 
            <a href="https://gist.github.com/gcwhitfield/a2764c0d991156a51d556ba71f06af56">code sample.</a>

            <br><br>
            
            <h3> Level 3 </h3>
            Similar to level 1, level 3 features many long hallways and geometric open rooms. 
            However, the main difference is that level 3's rooms are generated by sampling 
            from image textures whereas level 1's rooms are generated solely with code.

               The size of the rooms is randomly generated within a range of valid values, 
               similar to Level 1.
